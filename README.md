# imgur-gifv
Firefox addon that loads Imgur .gif images as .gifv.  I created this intially for myself, as I was tired of waiting for .gif
images to load on Imgur.  I also was tired of appending "v" to the .gif extension in my address bar.  Thus, I created this
addon.

# Installation
Install from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imgur-gifv/ or gifv.xpi
